#  Sonia's Portfolio 💁‍♀️💻

Hello 🙋‍♀️, this is the repo to my portfolio! 
<br>
<br>
During my time at the Dev Academy bootcamp where I learnt to code we had to create our own blog using HTML and CSS, and just for nostalgia's sake I have turned the blog into a React app but kept the styling and layout of my portfolio the same as my blog 😌.

Check out my portfolio [here](https://sonia-huynh.github.io/) to see what projects I am currently working on and what projects I had completed while at the bootcamp~
